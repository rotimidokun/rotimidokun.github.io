# Hi, Thank you for checking out my new game "Finding BigFoot".

 BigFoot is a little creature, lost in his habitat. He has a big problem; he gets lost very easily. All we want to do is to find him.
 
 Click on him when you find him and you will be notified if you did.
 
 Hint: BigFoot will get lost each time you find him, until you can no longer find him, which means you couldn't save him eventually.
